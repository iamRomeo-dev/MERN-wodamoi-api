## Configuration

Application configuration is provided by environment variables and accessed in code with `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.

Environments variables are loaded using the definitions in the `.env.defaults` file.
If you need to override some of them, you can create a `.env` file with your overrides.

> If new environment variables are required by the app, they can be added to the `.env.defaults` to document them.
